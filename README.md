## Introduction

A geolocation-based social network web application which allows users to upload image/video posts associated with their location, and view other posts nearby or on the map.

Developed with React and Ant-design. The app is deployed to Heroku. As this is only a demo, the backend database is scheduled to perform a clean up every three hours.
